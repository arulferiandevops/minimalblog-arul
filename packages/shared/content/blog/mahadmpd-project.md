## H2: Heading Two
Mahad MPD [Markdoc](https://mahadmpd.com) is an educational institution dedicated to Islamic families, aiming to cultivate peaceful and harmonious families. Currently, Ma'had MPD offers a diverse range of programs, exceeding 20+, with a total student population surpassing 13,000.

## Paragraph
This is a website profile creation project for mahadmpd.com, an Islamic education institution. The website includes the following sections:
- Home: featuring the main page providing an overview of Mahad MPD.
- About Us: containing a detailed profile page about Mahad MPD and its programs.
- Programs: including a registration and payment page integrated with a payment gateway.
- Blog: offering a page for the latest information and news related to the institution. Managed using a Content Management System (CMS).
- Download: providing a page for downloading resources offered by Mahad MPD.
- Contact: featuring a form to contact Mahad MPD.

I approach the development of this website comprehensively, covering planning, development, and deployment, essentially working on a Fullstack basis. The technology stack used includes:
- Next.JS
- Astro Template
- Strapi
- Docker
- AWS EC2
- Payment Gateway

Markdown is powered by [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/). This is an example post to demonstrate all the basic markdown syntax. You can author content using the familiar markdown syntax you already know.

## Inline formatting

Bold: **This text is bold**.

Italics: _This text is italics_.

Strikethrough: You can ~~strikethrough~~ text.

Inline code: You can add inline code like this `const hello = "world"`.

## Headings

The following HTML `<h2>`â€”`<h6>` elements represent five levels of section headings. `<h1>` is also available but not recommended since the post title is already a `<h1>` element it is not a good practice to have more than one `<h1>` elements in a page.

## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading Three

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six

## Paragraph

A standalone single paragraph of text.

Paragraphs can be multiline too when they constitute words that make up more than one line, i.e they wrap to the next line. Wow! I am really smart to write two lines of text that makes zero sense.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. And it's pretty long too. Long enough to wrap to next line. Surely it will wrap.

> You can use other Markdown syntax like `inline code` within a blockquote.

## Tables

| Italics   | Bold     | Code   |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| _italics_ | **bold** | `code` |

## List Types

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is done using [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). You can customise to whichever theme you want from the [plenty available prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).
